# CLAUDE.md

Browser GTA-style game. Three.js r128 (vendored at `src/vendor/`), plain
script tags in `index.html`, one global `CBZ` namespace, no build step, no
package.json. ~120k LOC across `src/`.

## HOW TO VERIFY WORK — the closed loop (read this first)

There is NO test framework here and we don't want one. Verification is
MATH over live game state — never rendered frames. OWNER DOCTRINE: tests
are numbers ("Sims testing"); how things LOOK is the owner's job, judged
by playing. Headless rendering runs ~60x slow (SwiftShader), so any gate
that waits on frames burns minutes to prove nothing — the fast loop reads
state directly and steps the sim by hand. Use after EVERY change:

1. **Syntax** — `node --check <file>` on every touched file. Free.
2. **Math gate** — `node tools/math-gate.mjs [--seeds 90210,1337]` — THE
   universal pass/fail. One headless boot; per seed: builds the world,
   asserts generator invariants (lot/shop/road counts, shop-door
   reachability, region bounds), terrain/biome doctrine (city-on-mountain,
   mountains-outside-snow, PEER-landmass region overlaps — nested venues
   and causeway links are legitimately excluded), then drives the sim
   DIRECTLY — `CBZ.stepSim(dt)` ticks the whole updater chain with no
   rendering, so hundreds of full-speed sim ticks (peds spawn, systems run,
   update-path crashes surface) cost seconds. Re-runs the first seed and
   asserts byte-identical counts + biome histogram (determinism law).
   Must print `MATHGATE: ok`. ~1-2 min for two seeds + determinism.
3. **Targeted in-page probes** — for behavior, write a throwaway CDP script
   (copy the boot boilerplate from `tools/math-gate.mjs`): boot headless
   Chromium, wait for `CBZ.bootComplete`, `Runtime.evaluate` straight into
   the live game, assert on real state (`CBZ.city.arena.lots`,
   `CBZ.cityCrowdAgent(i)`, `CBZ.colliders.length`…), and use
   `CBZ.stepSim(1/60)` bursts to advance time instantly instead of waiting.
   Minutes to write, seconds to run, tests the REAL game — never a mock.

VISUAL TOOLS — owner-request only, NEVER in the default loop (the owner
judges appearance by playing; do not spend loop time on screenshots):
`tools/studio.mjs` (asset turntables), `tools/street-shot.mjs` (street
scene), `tools/city-atlas.mjs` (top-down world), `tools/demolition-check.mjs`
(destroy→rebuild arc; its FLOATING-GEOMETRY AABB-chain invariant is still a
good pattern to copy for structure builders), `tools/smoke-play.mjs` (full
RENDERED boot + screenshot — the only gate that exercises the real render
path; run it once before a big deploy or when render-path code changed,
otherwise skip). `tools/terrain-map-audit.mjs` is the deep-dive superset of
the math gate's terrain sweep for terrain-focused work.

Escalate depth with risk: a color tweak needs (1); logic needs (1)+(2);
behavior/systems work needs all three. Never commit on (1) alone.

## Headless environment facts (save yourself the debugging)

- Chromium is at `/opt/pw-browsers/chromium`; flags used by every tool:
  `--headless=new --use-gl=angle --use-angle=swiftshader
  --enable-unsafe-swiftshader --no-sandbox`. Serve via
  `PORT=<n> python3 tools/devserver.py` (CDN is blocked; three.js is
  vendored locally — keep it that way).
- **Baseline console noise**: exactly one `ProgressEvent` error is
  pre-existing and acceptable; rare seed-dependent `computeBoundingSphere`
  NaN too. ANY other error is yours.
- **Sim time crawls headless** (~60x slower: SwiftShader fps + clamped dt).
  NEVER wait wall-clock for game-time events — jump state directly
  (`CBZ.dayCount(n)`, `CBZ.dayPhase(x)`) or burst `CBZ.stepSim(1/60)` in a
  loop (core/loop.js): each call ticks the full updater chain with no
  rendering, so 600 ticks ≈ 10 sim-seconds run at CPU speed.
- **Camera aiming from probes**: NEVER hand-roll teleport+yaw math — a
  sign-convention mistake once had a probe photographing the WRONG BUILDING
  for two rounds while every numeric check passed. Inject `tools/aimlib.js`
  (plain in-page JS) and use `__aim.atLot(lot)` / `__aim.at(...)`: it aims
  the player camera, waits real frames, PROJECTS the target through the
  live camera (NDC must be in-frustum and central), self-calibrates across
  yaw/pitch candidates, and reports collider occlusion. `ok:false` means
  your screenshot would be a lie — fail the gate, don't shoot. (See
  demolition-check.mjs for the wiring; evl needs `awaitPromise: true`.)
- Lots live at `CBZ.city.arena.lots` (the `arena` level, not `CBZ.city`).

## Engine systems — REUSE these, never re-invent

One conversation-long push turned several one-offs into shared grammar.
Before building anything adjacent, wire into the existing system:

- **Death/kill bus** — `src/city/killfeed.js`. EVERY death funnels through it
  (it wraps `cityKillPed`/`cityCrowdKill`/player death; lazy-retry hooks).
  New death sources call `CBZ.cityLogDeath(name, cause, {by})` or
  `CBZ.cityKillFeed(by, name, cause)`. It owns the ONLY sanctioned HUD
  popup (the Fortnite corner feed) — never toast a death yourself.
- **Boarding-door grammar** — `src/city/aircraft_doors.js` (phased
  walk→open→step→handover→close arcs; theft revert via onFail) and the
  airliner cabin/cockpit door easing in `island_airport.js`. Anything with
  a door the player passes through (vehicles, future rides) uses these
  beats; `src/city/elevators.js` is the gold standard.
- **Lock-on / scope** — `src/systems/lockon.js`. Missile-class weapons get
  targets via `CBZ.lockonFireTarget()` / `CBZ.lockonMissileSeek()`;
  scoping via `fpsScope/fpsCanScope/fpsScopeToggle`. ALL camera FOV
  writers must yield to `CBZ.fpsScopeFov()` (precedence: fitted optic >
  lockon scope) — a scope-blind FOV writer re-creates the "fake scope" bug.
- **Touch layer** — `src/systems/touch.js` + `touch_vehicle.js`. Fixed
  stick (rim = sprint, press = crouch), slide-holds (aim/scope→fire),
  verb pills (words for interactions, icons for combat), stale-touch
  sweepers. New on-screen controls join THIS layer; never add a parallel
  touch handler. Interaction popups on touch are tappable pills, and
  single-verb rides are SILENT (press/tap to take — see
  `interactions.js` SILENT_RIDE; the airliner BOARD/HIJACK card is the
  one sanctioned exception).
- **HUD doctrine** — the only popup is the killfeed. Rich info lives in
  logic/phone/leaderboards, not floating cards; aiming shows a floating
  `Lv.N Title` overhead pill (`aim_dossier.js`), full data stays
  available via `CBZ.cityActorDossier()`. Never render keyboard key
  glyphs on touch (`CBZ.touchActionPrompt` re-skins prompts).
- **Numeric world audits** — `tools/terrain-map-audit.mjs` (biome/relief
  grid, mountains-outside-snow, city-on-mountain, region overlaps) and
  `tools/world-audit.mjs` (object overlaps/lint). Terrain/layout changes
  verify with THESE (no-visual closed loop), then the smoke gate.
- **Camera polish flags** — `CAM_*` in `src/systems/camera.js` (occlusion
  follow, FP↔TP blend, vehicle free-look/look-back via
  `camFreeLook`/`camLookBack`/`camRecenterSuspended`, air bank, shoulder
  swap). Vehicle-recenter writers must respect `camRecenterSuspended()`.

## Hard rules that keep the game correct

- **Determinism**: world builds must be byte-identical per seed across
  clients (multiplayer). In any build/generation path use `CBZ.hash01(x, z,
  salt)` / `CBZ.hashN(...)` (position-hash) or `CBZ.seedStream(name)` —
  NEVER `Math.random`, and NEVER add/remove draws on a shared `rng()`
  stream (order-fragile). Runtime-only FX may use `Math.random`.
- `?seed=N` in the URL selects the world; tools accept a seed where relevant.
- Batching: `core/batch.js` merges static geometry once at load. Meshes with
  colliders/LOS refs or non-empty `userData` are spared. Per-building
  removal goes through `CBZ.batchHideGroup/batchShowGroup` — never dispose
  merged buffers.
- Explosion wrappers (`cityExplosion` et al.) are wrapped by several modules:
  copy EVERY `*Wrapped` marker forward when wrapping, and make handlers
  idempotent per blast (see demolition.js's `opts._demoSeen`).
- New feature flags: `CBZ.CONFIG.<AREA>_<BEHAVIOR>` in `src/config.js`,
  `if (CBZ.CONFIG.X == null) CBZ.CONFIG.X = default;` — every risky feature
  must be a one-line revert.
- New scripts load via a `<script>` tag in `index.html` — order matters
  (`config.js` → `seed.js` → world → systems).
