   units/species/bighorn_sheep.js — the bighorn sheep as NPC War fights it.

   OWNED BY: the bighorn sheep agent. This file is the whole animal for the
   battle: its numbers, its body, how it moves and how it fights. Edit this
   file (and shared helpers under src/units/kit/ if you must); never the
   battle's files.

   TODAY (wave A) every hook below falls back to what the game already has:
     body     src/city/wildlife/small_game.js (the bestiary's low-poly build)
     motion   the discovered gait rig: CBZ.wildlifeRig.buildGait / animateGait (city/wildlife_rig.js)
     fight    creature_combat's STOMP (rear and strike with the forefeet), driven by
              the battle's beastFight with the numbers below
   To redraw it: give `build` a lofted, skinned body (src/units/kit/loft.js,
   quadrig.js) and `animate` a planted-foot gait (src/units/kit/gait.js); see
   src/city/dogmodel.js for a complete animal built that way.

   STATS were the bestiary row + battle.html's derived beastTuning, baked
   here so the numbers live with the animal:
     hp spd danger bite scale   the species row (written back onto it, so the
                                bestiary and the battle can never disagree)
     chase march                m/s: the charge, and the pace on the march
     dmg rate                   one strike's damage (to a man), strikes per s scale
     brave                      never routs;  prey: fights nobody
